    <span>Cultural Adjustment can be understood as an ongoing process of acclimation to a culture distinct from the one you are used to. If you are new to Canada you will experience differences in the type of food, social interactions, sleeping accommodations, language, clothing and routine that you are accustomed to. It is going to take time to adjust. Perhaps you have just moved away from home or are a mature student coming to school for the first time, whatever your situation - it will take time to adjust. Be patient with yourself, and reach out for help when you need it.</span>
