    <p><span>Most colleges have fitness centers where students and teachers can go and work out. Look into how much a student gym membership is; it may be included in your tuition. The gym can be an intimidating place if you haven't spent much time in one. The first step is to inquire with the fitness centre about getting a personal trainer or staff member to show you around and also set you up with a program that you can follow. This is usually included in your membership fee. It will instill confidence in you as well as teach you how to work out safely. Having a gym buddy is also a good way to make you feel more comfortable in the gym setting and a good way for you to push each other to increase your fitness. At the gym you can focus on aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Aerobic exercises are focusing on cardio type exercises, which would be running, biking, walking, the elliptical and rowing. Anaerobic exercising focus more on lifting weights and is good for increasing muscle strength and strong bones.</span></p>
