Heatlhy Living Web Application for Algonquin College built by [Robert Gungor](mailto:rob@robgungor.com). Feel free to email with any questions.

This web application was built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) in a [Lineman](http://www.linemanjs.com) template.

Please see "README-lineman.md" for instructions on installation and compilation.

The only files needed for deployment are located in the "generated" folder. 

If your location is not at / on the server, the <base> tag will need to be updated as well as the links to css and js files. Contact Rob with any questions: 415-794-6613.

[Here is a working demo with paths updated](http://robgungor.com/healthy-alpha).
